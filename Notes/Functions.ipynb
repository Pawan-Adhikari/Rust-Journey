    "-Functions: Block of code to carry out specific task. Critical part of Rust as Rust is almost like a Pop.\n",
    "-Unit functions: Non return type functions.\n",
    "-Borrowing: Lending values to other parts of the code without taking ownership away from their original scopes.\n",
    "-Panic: Call syntax used to stop all execution in program.\n",
    "-Enumerator: Enum, is a data type representing a set of values where each value represents a distinct case.\n",
    "-Move: Rather than lending just the values(Like in case of borrowing), whole ownership is shifted from one scope to another.\n",
    "-Vector: Dyanmic array. Can shrink or grow.\n",
    "-Shadowing: Temporarily changing the definition and value of a variable within the same scope.\n",
