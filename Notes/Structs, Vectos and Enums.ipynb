    "Associated Function: A function that doesn't require self, allowing easy creation of a user instance with new constructor.\n",

    "Here, were are exploring two methods to add (using another vector) into a vector:\n",
    ".extend() and .append().\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever we pass a vector \"reference\" to .extend(), we are borrowing an immutable reference to the values of vector we want to copy from and then we are adding those values into the destination vector. There is no ownership transfer.\n",
    "\n",
    "But whenever we pass a vector itself to .extend(), we are transfering the ownership of values of original source vector and adding them to our destination vector. The reference to first source vector no longer exists and cannot be borrowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For .append(), we can only pass a mutable reference of the source vector. .append takes the value from that reference and moves that value over to the destination vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What Happens When You Use .append()?\n",
    "When you call vec1.append(&mut vec2), the following happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ownership Transfer:\n",
    "The elements of vec2 are moved into vec1. This means the ownership of the elements in vec2 is transferred to vec1.\n",
    "Memory Management:\n",
    "The memory holding the elements of vec2 is not freed. Instead, vec2's length is set to 0, and its capacity remains unchanged. The memory allocated for vec2 is still reserved, but it is now empty.\n",
    "Contiguous Memory:\n",
    "The elements from vec2 are appended to the end of vec1's contiguous memory block. If vec1 does not have enough capacity to hold the new elements, it reallocates its memory to a larger block and copies all its elements (including those from vec2) into the new block.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Why Doesn't an Empty Vector Print Garbage Values?\n",
    "In Rust, when you print an empty vector (e.g., vec2 after append), it does not print garbage values because:\n",
    "\n",
    "Length is Set to 0:\n",
    "After the append, vec2's length is explicitly set to 0. This means Rust knows there are no valid elements to print.\n",
    "Memory Safety:\n",
    "Rust ensures memory safety by not allowing access to uninitialized or invalid memory. Even though the memory previously used by vec2 is still allocated, it is not considered part of the vector because the length is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What Happens When You Use .extend() with a Source Vector?\n",
    "When you call .extend() with a source vector, the behavior depends on whether you pass the source vector by value or by reference:\n",
    "\n",
    "Case 1: Passing by Reference (&vec3)\n",
    "Cloning:\n",
    "The elements of vec3 are cloned into vec1. The original vec3 remains unchanged.\n",
    "Memory Management:\n",
    "The memory of vec3 is not affected because it is only borrowed.\n",
    "Case 2: Passing by Value (vec3)\n",
    "Ownership Transfer:\n",
    "The ownership of vec3 is transferred to vec1. This means vec3 becomes invalid after the extend call.\n",
    "Memory Management:\n",
    "Both the memory holding the elements of vec3 and the memory holding vec3 itself are freed. This is why vec3 cannot be used after the extend call."
